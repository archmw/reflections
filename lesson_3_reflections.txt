When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?
Remote repository can be used for two purposes, first it keeps back up of 
your code, and you can share your code with others to help the coder community.
second it may be useful when some of coders are working on same project but 
from different locations.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It is necessary to stay updated, otherwise later with lots of commits at
either git or at remote, code may gets confilct or it might get difficult
to later pull it properly.
