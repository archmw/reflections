When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?
Remote repository can be used for two purposes, first it keeps back up of 
your code, and you can share your code with others to help the coder community.
second it may be useful when some of coders are working on same project but 
from different locations.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It is necessary to stay updated, otherwise later with lots of commits at
either git or at remote, code may gets confilct or it might get difficult
to later pull it properly.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you 
use one instead of another?

Forks is getting a cope of repository in your own github account. Any changes 
you make will not affect the origin repository held by the owner. you can then 
get this repository to your local machine to work on it as and when required.

Clone is getting copy of repository to local machine, it possible when you
have link to repository on github or you can even clone same repository on your
local machine from one location to another.

Branch: Branch is when you do not want to disturb the current status of code, but
rather you are planning to add a feature to your code and you do not want to publish
this feature utill it is completely tested OK. Or you can branch you repository when
you want a new coder to work on any part of code without disturbing the current status
of code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
stored locally?
you can compare the changes you made, if some bug occured, you may need to revert back.
or you may refer to code or logic.
