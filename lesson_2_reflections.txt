What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When a repository is initialized, empty git repository gets created.
It is required in order to make a new repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and 
the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area holds the files which are need to be tracked while 
working directory hold all files need to run a project and few 
more informative or other files as well .
You may not need to track all the files in the directory, that 
seperated staging area from working direcory.
